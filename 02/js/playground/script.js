/**
 * Assignment 2 JavaScript Playground
 * 
 * This set of exercises will give you some practice with writing JavaScript
 * to solve some simple data manipulation problems. This is in preparation
 * of the next module, where you will apply these skills in the context
 * of a simple web app.
 * 
 * This script has already been linked to `index.html` in this directory for you.
 * Open `index.html` in the browser to see your results. Be sure to refresh
 * as you code. Don't be afraid to throw in a `Console.log(...)` and use the 
 * developer tools in the browser for troubleshooting!
